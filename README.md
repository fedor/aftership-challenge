Join us if you can!

## Getting Started
The goal of this challenge is to get the tracking information from the courier's system.

There are 3 tests:

```
www.usps.com: 9102999999302024326992
www.hongkongpost.com: CP889331175HK
www.dpduk.co.uk: 15502370264989N

```

## The Output Format

The first thing you should do is read `test/index.js`. It is the **canonical reference**. As long as your crawler correctly implements the reference tests, it is considered a correct solution.


# Usage

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your own Github `public` repository and development machine. Do NOT fork, as other candidates would be able to see your solution. Do preserve commit history so it is easy for us to add your repository as a remote.
2. Send us a link to the public repository you used and an estimate of how long you will take
3. Run `npm install`
4. Implement `Courier` in `lib/index.js`
5. Ensure all tests pass in node via `npm test`
6. When finished, send us an email to ask for a review

## Hints

* Before starting, try to see how AfterShip API work, you will get a better idea what tracking info should return.
* You can use ANY method to get the tracking result, including API, web crawler, or even you paid someone else to code for you. LoL

## Scoring

There is no scoring at all.

What we want to know is HOW do you solve the problems.

However,

**You will be graded on how easy-to-{read,maintain,verify} your code and documentation are.** Really think from the perspective of what would happen if we had to actually integrate your code into our production environment.

Ideally your solution is **easily extensible** as we add additional types of test cases.
